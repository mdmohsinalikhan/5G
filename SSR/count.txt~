Abstract. IMSI-catchers are still in existence in all the 3GPP defined
cellular networks. Pseudonym based solutions to defeat IMSI-catchers
have been published in the recent years. We have found one vulnerabil-
ity in these solutions. The vulnerability enables an attacker to convince
the home network (HN) to forget an old pseudonym of a legitimate UE
and compute a new one. The attacker does not need any participation
of the legitimate UE to mount this attack. A malicious UE or a serving
network (SN) can exploit this vulnerability to kick a legitimate UE out of
service. We show that, exploiting this vulnerability, a novel DDoS attack
can be mounted against an entire cellular network. The attack can send
50 percent of the UEs out of service using a reasonably large botnet of
mobile users. We justify our claim by an analytical argument backed by
a simulation. Even though, in principle, a malicious SN can also exploit
the vulnerability, we argue that the SN can not gain anything meaning-
ful before the attack is detected and stopped. Besides, an SN can behave
maliciously in other even more fatal ways. Hence it is not important to
protect against a malicious serving network in this context. We present
a solution to fight against the DDoS attack by piggybacking the location
update message sent by the serving network to the home network. We
present a qualitative analysis of our solution. We argue that our solution
is immune to the the DDoS attack and still protects the identity privacy,
and remains backward compatible with the legacy networks. We also dis-
cuss other practical issues of the usability of pseudonyms from charging
and lawful interception point of view that appear to be ignored so
