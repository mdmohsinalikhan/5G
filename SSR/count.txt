IMSI-catchers are still in existence in all the 3GPP defined networks. Pseudonym based solutions to defeat IMSI-catchers have been published in the recent years. We have found one vulnerability in these solutions. The vulnerability enables an attacker to convince the home network (HN) to forget an old pseudonym of a legitimate UE without any participation of the legitimate UE. A malicious UE can exploit this vulnerability to kick a legitimate UE out of service. We show that, exploiting this vulnerability, a novel DDoS attack can be mounted against an entire network. The attack can send 50 percent of the UEs out of service using a reasonably large botnet of mobile users. We justify our claim by an analytical argument backed by a simulation. Even though, in principle, a malicious serving network (SN) can also exploit the vulnerability, we argue that the SN can not gain anything meaningful before the attack is detected and stopped. Besides, an SN can behave maliciously in other even more fatal ways. We present a solution to fight against the DDoS attack by using the location update message sent by an SN to an HN. We argue that our solution is immune to the the DDoS attack, protects the identity privacy, and remains backward compatible. We also discuss other practical issues of the usability of pseudonyms from charging and lawful interception point of view that appear to be ignored so far.
